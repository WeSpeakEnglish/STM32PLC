# STM32PLC
The PLC based on STM32F746
This REPO dedicate the PLC implemented on the new ST's STM32F7 MCU.
It consist:
1. the LCD driver as native for display's without a controller time management system on displays (8", 9" 800x480 are tested)
2. The GIU library suppors multilayer paradigma (Z-indexed layers) to displaying objects on different orders while they will put to the screen.
3. The displaying of images support "invisible" colour, setted up by user to provide displaying such things as button with rounded corners
4. Two CAN's!
5. RS-485 and RS-232!
6. LM75 on I2C, we read temperature in easy manner in float point format, also I2C to an external device 
7. PLC ready to drive tw8819, up to 4 cameras PAL/NTSC!
8. 2 analog inputs and two powerful outputs, whitch can connect the load.
9. The PCF8563 RTC on board to keep the time for a long time
10. Touch screen STMPE811 on board
11. Power sound class D amplifier on board to provide "talking" functions
12. GPS module could be soldered and controlled via UART
